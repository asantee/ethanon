Overview of the Audiere API

Everything is in the audiere namespace.  After #including <audiere.h>,
you can enter the line "using namespace audiere;" or explicitly
qualify the API symbols, i.e. "audiere::GetVersion();".

Every Audiere class has an associated refcounted smart pointer type.
For example, class File has a FilePtr type which manages the number of
references on the File objects.  (For the curious, FilePtr is a
typedef to RefPtr<File>.)  Remember!!  FilePtr is NOT the same as
File*.  File* does not automatically manage references, and is
therefore unsafe.  If you don't understand the difference, just use
FilePtr.

All factory functions return an object with an initial reference count
of 0.  This facilitates reasonable RefPtr behavior (That is, ref() on
construction or assignment, unref() on destruction).  Unfortunately,
when using Audiere from a language without smart pointers, such as
Delphi, one must be careful to ref() the object before calling
unref().
