[STRUCTURE] 
[
    [DESCRIPTION]
    Set these values marked to tell fmod what sort of sound to create when the codec open callback is called.<br>
    The format, channels, frequency and lengthpcm tell FMOD what sort of sound buffer to create when you initialize your code. <br>
    If you wrote an MP3 codec that decoded to stereo 16bit integer PCM for a 44khz sound, you would specify FMOD_SOUND_FORMAT_PCM16, and channels would be equal to 2, and frequency would be 44100.<br>

    [REMARKS]
    Members marked with [r] mean the variable is modified by FMOD and is for reading purposes only.  Do not change this value.<br>
    Members marked with [w] mean the variable can be written to.  The user can set the value.<br>
    <br>
    1.07 Note.  'blockalign' member which was in bytes has been removed.   'pcmblocksize' is now the replacement, and is measured in PCM samples only, not bytes.  This is purely to support buffering 
    internal to FMOD for codecs that are not sample accurate.
    <br>
    Note: When registering a codec, format, channels, frequency and lengthpcm must be supplied, otherwise there will be an error.<br>
    This structure is optional if FMOD_CODEC_GETWAVEFORMAT_CALLBACK is specified.<br>
    An array of these structures may be needed if FMOD_CODEC_STATE::numsubsounds is larger than 1.

    Codec plugin structure that is passed into each callback.<br>

    'numsubsounds' should be 0 if the file is a normal single sound stream or sound.  Examples of this would be .WAV, .WMA, .MP3, .AIFF.<br>
    'numsubsounds' should be 1+ if the file is a container format, and does not contain wav data itself.  Examples of these types would be FSB (contains multiple sounds), DLS (contain instruments).<br>
    The waveformat value should point to an arrays of information based on how many subsounds are in the format.  If the number of subsounds is 0 then it should point to 1 waveformat, the same as if the number of subsounds was 1.  If subsounds was 100 for example, there should be a pointer to an array of 100 waveformat structures.<br>

    The waveformat pointer is optional and could be 0, if using FMOD_CODEC_GETWAVEFORMAT_CALLBACK is preferred.<br>

    When a sound has 1 or more subsounds, the caller must play the individual sounds specified by first obtaining the subsound with Sound::getSubSound.
